TUPLES 
1. A list contains names of boys and girls as its elements. Boysâ€™ names are stored as tuples. 
Write a program to find out number of boys and girls in the list.
names = [("John",), "Alice", ("Mike",), "Sophia", ("Jake",)]
boys = sum(1 for name in names if isinstance(name, tuple))
girls = len(names) - boys
print("Number of boys:", boys, "Number of girls:", girls)

Output: Number of boys: 3 Number of girls: 2

2. A list contains tuples containing roll no., name and age of student. Write a python 
program to create three lists separately for roll no., name and age.
students = [(1, "John", 20), (2, "Alice", 21), (3, "Mike", 19)]
roll_no = [student[0] for student in students]
names = [student[1] for student in students]
ages = [student[2] for student in students]
print("Roll Numbers:", roll_no, "Names:", names, "Ages:", ages)

 Output: Roll Numbers: [1, 2, 3] Names: ['John', 'Alice', 'Mike'] Ages: [20, 21, 19]

 3. Suppose a date is represented as a tuple (d, m, y). Create two date tuples and find the 
number of days between the two dates.
from datetime 
import date
date1 = (1, 1, 2023)
date2 = (10, 1, 2023)
days_between = (date(date2[2], date2[1], date2[0]) - date(date1[2], date1[1], date1[0])).days
print("Days between:", days_between)

 Output: Days between: 9

4. Create a list of tuples containing a food item and its price. Sort the tuples in descending
 order by price.
food_prices = [("Burger", 50), ("Pizza", 100), ("Fries", 30)]
sorted_food_prices = sorted(food_prices, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
print("Sorted food prices:", sorted_food_prices)

 Output: Sorted food prices: [('Pizza', 100), ('Burger', 50), ('Fries', 30)]

 5. Remove empty tuple(s) from the list of tuples.
tuples_list = [(), (1, 2), (), (3, 4)]
non_empty_tuples = [t for t in tuples_list if t]
print("Non-empty tuples:", non_empty_tuples)

 Output: Non-empty tuples: [(1, 2), (3, 4)]

 6. Modify an element of a tuple.
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
modified_tuple = my_tuple[:1] + (99,) + my_tuple[2:]
print("Modified tuple:", modified_tuple)

Output: Modified tuple: (1, 99, 3)

 7. Delete an element of a tuple.
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
deleted_element_tuple = my_tuple[:1] + my_tuple[2:]
print("Tuple after deletion:", deleted_element_tuple)

 Output: Tuple after deletion: (1, 3)
