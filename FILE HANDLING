FILE HANDLING 

1. Write a program to create a csv file that we can directly open in MS-Excel
import csv
data = [["Roll No", "Name", "Marks1", "Marks2", "Marks3"], [1, "Alice", 85, 90, 95], [2, "Bob", 78, 82, 88], [3, "Charlie", 92, 87, 85]]
with open("students.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)
print("CSV file created successfully.")

Output: CSV file created successfully. (students.csv can be opened in MS-Excel)

 2. Read the data stored in MS-Excel file and convert it into a dictionary
import csv
with open("students.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    student_data = {}
    for row in reader:
        total = int(row["Marks1"]) + int(row["Marks2"]) + int(row["Marks3"])
        student_data[row["Roll No"]] = {"Name": row["Name"], "Marks": [row["Marks1"], row["Marks2"], row["Marks3"]], "Total": total}
print(student_data)

Output: {'1': {'Name': 'Alice', 'Marks': ['85', '90', '95'], 'Total': 270}, '2': {'Name': 'Bob', 'Marks': ['78', '82', '88'], 'Total': 248}, ...}

 3. Accept contact details from the user and create a vcard
name = input("Enter Name: ")
phone = input("Enter Phone Number: ")
email = input("Enter Email: ")
vcard = f"BEGIN:VCARD\nVERSION:3.0\nFN:{name}\nTEL:{phone}\nEMAIL:{email}\nEND:VCARD"
with open("contact.vcf", "w") as file:
    file.write(vcard)
print("VCard created successfully.")

Output: VCard created successfully. (contact.vcf can be saved to your mobile)

 4. Create a specific subdirectory and copy one file from another subdirectory to this newly created subdirectory
import os
import shutil
os.makedirs("New_Subdirectory", exist_ok=True)
shutil.copy("source_file.txt", "New_Subdirectory/destination_file.txt")
print("File copied successfully.")

Output: File copied successfully.

 5. Copy contents of one file to another, replacing all lowercase characters into uppercase
with open("source.txt", "r") as src, open("destination.txt", "w") as dest:
    dest.write(src.read().upper())
print("File copied and converted to uppercase successfully.")

Output: File copied and converted to uppercase successfully.

 6. Merge lines alternatively from two files into a new file
with open("file1.txt", "r") as f1, open("file2.txt", "r") as f2, open("merged_file.txt", "w") as merged:
    lines1, lines2 = f1.readlines(), f2.readlines()
    for i in range(max(len(lines1), len(lines2))):
        if i < len(lines1): merged.write(lines1[i])
        if i < len(lines2): merged.write(lines2[i])
print("Files merged successfully.")

Output: Files merged successfully.

 7. Serialize and deserialize Employee object
import pickle
employee = {"empcode": 123, "empname": "John Doe", "Date of Joining": "2023-01-01", "Salary": 50000}
with open("employee.pkl", "wb") as file:
    pickle.dump(employee, file)
with open("employee.pkl", "rb") as file:
    deserialized_employee = pickle.load(file)
print(deserialized_employee)

Output: {'empcode': 123, 'empname': 'John Doe', 'Date of Joining': '2023-01-01', 'Salary': 50000}

 8. Create another text file deleting the words ‘a’, ‘the’, ‘an’ and replacing them with blank space
with open("input.txt", "r") as src, open("output.txt", "w") as dest:
    text = src.read()
    for word in ["a", "the", "an"]:
        text = text.replace(f" {word} ", " ")
    dest.write(text)
print("Words removed successfully.")
